## Objectives

Your role is to deploy this distributed application on a Kubernetes cluster. To do this, you will use the information in the Docker Compose file and go through the following steps:

    1. Create a deployment for each container.

    2. Create a service for each deployment. Be sure to use an internal or external service, whichever is more appropriate.

    3. Use a volume for the database.

### Elements √† notre disposition :

**fleetman-position-simulator** : a Spring Boot application that continuously transmits fictitious vehicle positions.
**fleetman-queue** : an Apache ActiveMQ queue that receives and transmits these positions.
**fleetman-position-tracker** : a Spring Boot application that consumes these received positions and stores them in a MongoDB database. They are then made available via a RESTful API.
**fleetman-mongo** : instance of the MongoDB database.
**fleetman-api-gateway** : a Gateway API serving as an entry point for the web application.
**fleetman-web-app** : the web application presented above.

## Installation and Launching Fleetman with Helm

### Prerequisites

Helm is the package manager for Kubernetes.
Ensure that you have the following tools installed on your machine :
https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/


### Clone the Project

‚ö†Ô∏è**NE PAS OUBLIER DE METTRE LE GIT EN PUBLIC**‚ö†Ô∏è

Clone the Fleetman project from your Git repository:
git clone

https://github.com/MitryDim/fleetman.git

Go on the helm directory : `cd fleetman`



### Configuration

` values.yaml` File
Open the values.yaml file in the fleetman/charts/fleetman/ directory.
Modify the values according to your needs, especially those under deployments for each application.
Ensure Docker images and probe configurations (liveness and readiness) are correct.

### Installation with Helm

In the fleetman/charts/fleetman/ directory, run the Helm command to install the Fleetman project:

`helm install your-release-name .`
Replace your-release-name with the desired name for your deployment.

### Verification of Installation

Check that the pods are running:
`kubectl get pods`

### Verify that the services are deployed:

`kubectl get services`

### Accessing Services

You can access the deployed services using IP addresses or service names. For example, for access to webapp service, you can access the application via http://127.0.0.1:30080.

**Uninstallation with Helm**
If needed, you can uninstall Fleetman using the Helm command:
`helm uninstall your-release-name`
