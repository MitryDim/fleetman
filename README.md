# Fleetman


### Objectives

Your role is to deploy this distributed application on a Kubernetes cluster. To do this, you will use the information in the Docker Compose file and go through the following steps:

    1. Create a deployment for each container.

    2. Create a service for each deployment. Be sure to use an internal or external service, whichever is more appropriate.

    3. Use a volume for the database.


### Elements Ã  notre disposition :

**fleetman-position-simulator** : a Spring Boot application that continuously transmits fictitious vehicle positions.
**fleetman-queue** : an Apache ActiveMQ queue that receives and transmits these positions.
**fleetman-position-tracker** : a Spring Boot application that consumes these received positions and stores them in a MongoDB database. They are then made available via a RESTful API.
**fleetman-mongo** : instance of the MongoDB database.
**fleetman-api-gateway** : a Gateway API serving as an entry point for the web application.
**fleetman-web-app** : the web application presented above.
